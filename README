Marketplace
===========

This plugin adds sales inventory models:
Model, Make, Manufacturer, Product, Offer, Price, Cost, Vendor

This plugin requires these other plugins to be installed:
  * engines
  * make_resourceful
  * indexer
  * trainyard

The standard initialization of an engine plugin is also required.
In your application's routes.rb add this line:

  map.from_plugin :marketplace

Run this from the command line (necessary only once after all engine plugins are installed):

  script/generate plugin_migration && rake db:migrate
